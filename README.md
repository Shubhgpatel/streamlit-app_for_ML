# 📊 Linear Regression Explorer (Streamlit App)

This is a simple interactive Streamlit app that helps visualize how linear regression works. You can experiment with the **intercept (θ₀)** and **slope (θ₁)** to see how the best-fit line changes and how it affects the **cost function (Mean Squared Error)**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive sliders to adjust **θ₀ (intercept)** and **θ₁ (slope)**
- Real-time visualization of:
  - Noisy dataset
  - Prediction line
  - Cost (J) value
- Great for learning and teaching the fundamentals of linear regression

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
streamlit run app1.py
```

Then open the local server URL shown in your terminal.

---

## 📚 Learning Objective

This app was built to strengthen my understanding of **linear regression**, particularly how the intercept and slope affect model predictions and cost.

Feel free to clone, fork, or contribute!

## 🧠 Try It Yourself

Can you find the best combination of θ₀ and θ₁ that minimizes the cost (J)? Adjust the sliders and observe!
